[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen#History) is the Japanese
philosophy of constantly reinventing daily routines to become more

Most FOSS projects enjoy limited popularity with little internet
presence. For such projects, official documentation is often the only
source of information available to the user. But regardless of scale, do
you measure the effectiveness of your documentation? A user searching
the docs is often distressed and is in a hurry, so documentation must be
clear, easy to navigate, and should answer most "how to do X" questions.
As authors and maintainers do we really know if our documentation is
helpful?

This is a simple web service to collect anonymous feedback.
